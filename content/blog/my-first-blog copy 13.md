## What Is a Matching Engine?

A matching engine works by continuously matching incoming buy orders with existing sell orders, and vice versa, according to a set of rules.

> "It ensures the orders are matched based on price-time priority, providing fairness and speed." ‚Äì _Trading Systems Handbook_

## How Does It Work?

The engine typically follows these steps:

1. **Receive order:** The system receives a new order from a trader.
2. **Order validation:** Checks if the order is valid.
3. **Order matching:** Compares with opposite orders in the order book.
4. **Trade execution:** Executes the trade if a match is found.
5. **Order book update:** Updates the order book accordingly.
