**Latency** in trading refers to the time delay between a trader’s action and its execution on the exchange.

---

## Why Is Latency Critical?

In high-frequency trading (HFT), even microseconds can impact profit. Latency affects the speed at which an order is:

- Sent from the client to the exchange
- Processed and matched
- Acknowledged back to the client

---

## Types of Latency

1. **Network Latency** – Delay over physical infrastructure
2. **Processing Latency** – Time taken by software to process an order
3. **Exchange Latency** – Internal matching delays at the trading venue

---

## Minimizing Latency

- Using co-location (servers near the exchange)
- Optimizing hardware (FPGA/ASIC use)
- Reducing code complexity
